Somewhat hidden on the side street of Avenida Guillermo Prieto, Taco Alley is known for its 5 to 6 taco stands located all in a row.\n      We didnâ€™t see much differentiation between each stand, so our plan was to start at the first stand, and eat a different item from each vendor.  Each stall has various meats (beef, chorizo, pork, etc.) sizzling on a grill.\n    </div>',console.log("fire")})();
